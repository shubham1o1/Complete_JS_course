# Advanced JavaScript: Objects and Functions

## Everything is an Object : Inheritance and the Prototype Chain:

- Not everything but almost everything is object in javascript.
- We have two types of data types in javascript: Primitives and Everything Else
- **Primitive:** Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, Null
- **Everything Else**: Arrays, Functioins, Objects, Dates, Wrappers for Numbers/Strings/Booleans, ... (_They are an object_)

### The Object Oriented Paradigm:

- Objects interact with one another through methods and properties
- Used to store data, structure applications into modules and keeping code clean.
